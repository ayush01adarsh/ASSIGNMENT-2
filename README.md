# ASSIGNMENT-2

Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd 
For this task, I wrote a script that asks the user for a number and then tells them if that number is even or odd. I used the modulo operator % to check the remainder. 
How to Run
Run the script.
Type in any whole number.
The program will print the result

Task 2: Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50
In this task, I practiced using a for loop. The program starts at 1 and adds every number up until it reaches 50. I used a variable called total_sum to keep track of the math. 
How it works
It uses range(1, 51) because Python stops right before the last number.
It adds each number to the total.
It prints the final answer at the very end.
